# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements four distinct categories of Android app widgets to demonstrate different widget functionalities and user interaction patterns. The widgets will showcase information display, user controls, data collections, and hybrid functionality within a single Android application. Each widget category serves a specific purpose and provides users with different ways to interact with the app from their home screen.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Information Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view real-time information on my home screen through a widget, so that I can quickly access important data without opening the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the information widget is added to the home screen THEN the system SHALL display current date and time
2. WHEN the widget updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the displayed information automatically
3. WHEN the user taps the widget THEN the system SHALL open the main application
4. IF the widget cannot retrieve information THEN the system SHALL display a default message
5. WHEN the widget is resized THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately

### Requirement 2: Control Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control app functions directly from my home screen widget, so that I can perform quick actions without opening the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the control widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL show interactive buttons and toggles
2. WHEN the user taps a control button THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding action immediately
3. WHEN a toggle is switched THEN the system SHALL update the app state and provide visual feedback
4. WHEN an action is performed THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message or visual indicator
5. IF a control action fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 3: Collection Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse through a list or grid of items in a widget, so that I can view and interact with multiple data items from my home screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the collection widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a scrollable list or grid of items
2. WHEN the user scrolls through items THEN the system SHALL load additional content as needed
3. WHEN an item is tapped THEN the system SHALL perform the associated action or open detailed view
4. WHEN the data source is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the widget content automatically
5. IF no items are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4: Hybrid Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want a widget that combines information display with interactive controls, so that I can both view data and perform actions in a single widget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hybrid widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL show both informational content and interactive controls
2. WHEN information is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the display while maintaining control state
3. WHEN controls are used THEN the system SHALL update both the widget state and any displayed information
4. WHEN the widget is interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback for both information and control elements
5. IF any component fails THEN the system SHALL continue to function with the remaining working components

### Requirement 5: Widget Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily add, configure, and manage different widget types, so that I can customize my home screen experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a widget THEN the system SHALL provide clear options for each widget category
2. WHEN a widget is configured THEN the system SHALL save the settings and apply them immediately
3. WHEN widgets are resized THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability
4. WHEN the app is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing widget configurations
5. IF a widget encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options or fallback display

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want widgets to be efficient and responsive, so that they don't negatively impact device performance or battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN widgets update THEN the system SHALL minimize battery and CPU usage
2. WHEN multiple widgets are active THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently
3. WHEN the device is low on resources THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce widget functionality
4. WHEN widgets are not visible THEN the system SHALL pause unnecessary updates
5. IF memory is constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential widget functions
